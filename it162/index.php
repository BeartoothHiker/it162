 <p>Hello and welcome to my IT 162 workspace.  My name is Jeremy and am a Sofwtare Engineer studying Web and Mobile Development at Seattle Central. I have been programming in Windows and embedded systems for awhile, and I am excited to learn how to build modern websites. The programming and scripting is pretty natural for me, but I find the graphic design to be challenging. My longer term goal is move to a Solutions Architect role focusing on full stack technologies.</p>
 <p>My wife and I have two teenage boys, one who is attending Seattle Central. We also have a goofy golden doodle and a couple of naughty kitties (one who is addicted to popcorn and tortilla chips).</p>
 <p>Outside of work, I like to get outdoors with my boys. We have been on a number of backpacking trips in Montana, Wyoming and Washignton.  More often, however, my wife and I enjoy playing board and card games with our boys.<p>
